# Ruby Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal Ruby learning notes!  
This repository records everything I learn — from basic syntax, small experiments, to deeper concepts as I grow.

## 📌 Goals
- Build a solid foundation in Ruby.
- Practice writing clean, readable code.
- Document every concept in a simple and structured way.
- Improve step by step while keeping everything organized.
